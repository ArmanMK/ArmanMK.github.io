I am a Physics Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/networks/index.html">Advanced Computer Networking Research Group</a> at UMass Amherst. Previousely, I have been a research assistant in <a href="http://softmatter.physics.sharif.edu/"> Biophysics and Soft Condensed Matter Group</a> at the Sharif UNiversity of Technology were I received my Master's degree in biophysics. 

My research interests are in the intersection of physics, network science, computer science and biological sciences. 

My current Ph.D. research can be categorized in three distinct but connected topics:

1. Robustness metrics for network analysis

2. Machine learning techniques for graph structured data

3. Pattern formation in reaction diffusion systems

Please feel free to contact me for comments on my research, ideas for collaboration, or to have a chat about a scientific idea that excites you.

I will be graduating in Spring 2019 and I am looking for Postdoctoral/Research positions.
